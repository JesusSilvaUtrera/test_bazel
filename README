Repository to test how Bazel works to build and test projects automatically using different languages (Python and C++ currently).

To add the dependencies needed for your python project:

1. Create a venv: `python -m venv ./venv`
2. Source it: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install your requirements: `pip install -r 'path_to_requirements'`
4. List the packages installed on the venv:. `pip freeze`
5. Copy that list of packages to the `requirements_lock.txt`

Now you can execute your python project, and all the required packages will be installed.
